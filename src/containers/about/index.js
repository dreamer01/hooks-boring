				<Heading>About Creator ?</Heading>
				<Text>
					I love developing applications and solution which tend to solve
					complex problems. Iâ€™m creating web and mobile experiences for the next
					generation consumer-facing companies. I am also big time sucker for
					design and illustration, when I am free I like to do some graphic
					design work. If I find an amazing color palette or font, I have to
					build an app or website using them, because of this I have many
					unfinished side projects.
